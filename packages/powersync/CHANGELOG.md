## 1.15.1

 - Support latest versions of `package:sqlite3` and `package:sqlite_async`.
 - Stream client: Improve `disconnect()` while a connection is being opened.
 - Stream client: Support binary sync lines with Rust client and compatible PowerSync service versions.
 - Sync client: Improve parsing error responses.

## 1.15.0

 - Update the PowerSync core extension to `0.4.2`.
 - Add support for [raw tables](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/use-case-examples/raw-tables), which are user-managed
   regular SQLite tables instead of the JSON-based views managed by PowerSync.

## 1.14.1

 - Rust client: Fix uploading local writs after reconnect.
 - `PowerSyncDatabase.withDatabase`: Rename `loggers` parameter to `logger` for consistency.
 - Fix parsing HTTP errors for sync service unavailability.

## 1.14.0

Add a new sync client implementation written in Rust instead of Dart. While
this client is still experimental, we intend to make it the default in the 
future. The main benefit of this client is faster sync performance, but 
upcoming features will also require this client.
We encourage interested users to try it out by passing `SyncOptions` to the
`connect` method:

```dart
database.connect(
  connector: YourConnector(),
  options: const SyncOptions(
    syncImplementation: SyncClientImplementation.rust,
  ),
);
```

Switching between the clients can be done at any time without compatibility
issues. If you run into issues with the new client, please reach out to us!

## 1.13.1

- Use `package:http` instead of `package:fetch_client` on the web (since the former now uses fetch as well).
- Allow disconnecting in the credentials callback of a connector.
- Deprecate retry and CRUD upload durations as fields and independent parameters. Use the new `SyncOptions` class instead.
- Fix sync progress report after a compaction or defragmentation on the sync service.

## 1.13.0

* Report real-time progress information about downloads through `SyncStatus.downloadProgress`.
* Add `trackPreviousValues` option on `Table` which sets `CrudEntry.previousValues` to previous values on updates.
* Add `trackMetadata` option on `Table` which adds a `_metadata` column that can be used for updates.
  The configured metadata is available through `CrudEntry.metadata`.
* Add `ignoreEmptyUpdates` option which skips creating CRUD entries for updates that don't change any values.

This release improves the default log output and errors to better assist in debugging.

Breaking changes:

- Different error and exception classes are now used by the library, including `CredentialsException`, `SyncResponseException` and `PowerSyncProtocolException`, instead of more generic `AssertionError` and `HttpException`.

Other changes:

- The library now logs to the console in debug builds by default. To get the old behavior, use `logger: attachedLogger` in the `PowerSyncDatabase` constructor.
- Log messages have been improved to better explain the sync process and errors.

## 1.1.1

- Fix error occasionally occurring when calling `powersync.connect()` right when opening the database.
- Update getting started docs.

- Fix network error messages only containing a single character in some cases.
- Update `sqlite_async` dependency:
  - Supports catching errors in transactions and continuing the transaction.

- Update `uuid` dependency:
  - Now uses `CryptoRNG` from `uuid` package now that the performance improvements are upstream.
- Requires Dart ^3.2.0 / Flutter ^3.16.0.

## 1.0.0

## 0.4.2

## 0.4.1

- Use Apache 2.0 license.
- Update uuid dependency.

## 0.4.0

Improvements:

- Some parameters to `PowerSyncCredentials` are now optional.
- Upgrade dependencies.

## 0.4.0-preview.6

New functionality:

- Include transaction ids on crud entries, allowing transactions to be grouped together.
- Simplify implementation of `PowerSyncBackendConnector` by automatically handling token caching.

Fixes:

- Only check token expiration on the server, avoiding issues when the local time is out of sync.
- Fix some edge case errors that would kill the sync Isolate.
- Fix errors when disconnecting shortly after connecting.

Breaking changes:

- `PowerSyncDatabase.disconnect()` now returns `Future<void>` instead of `void`.
- Subclasses of `PowerSyncBackendConnector` must now implement `fetchCredentials()` instead of `refreshCredentials()` + `getCredentials()`.

Other changes:

- Update sqlite_async dependency to 0.4.0: <https://pub.dev/packages/sqlite_async/changelog>

## 0.3.0-preview.5

- Link github repository.

## 0.3.0-preview.4

The low-level SQLite-related code is extracted into a separate [sqlite_async](https://pub.dev/packages/sqlite_async) package.
`sqlite_async` handles the the database connection, connection pooling, Isolate management, queries,
transactions, default options, watching, and migrations.

The `powersync` package now just adds automatic sync and dynamic schema management on top. This makes it easy to switch between
using PowerSync, or just using a local database directly.

Breaking changes:

- `TableUpdate` renamed to `UpdateNotification`.
- `PowerSyncDatabase.connectionFactory()` renamed to `PowerSyncDatabase.isolateConnectionFactory()`,
  and should only be used to pass the connection to a different isolate.
- All tables apart from `ps_crud` are dropped and re-created when upgrading to this version.
  This will not result in any data loss, but a full re-sync is required.

Fixes:

- Fix queries not watching the correct tables in some cases.
- Fix performance issues on bulk insert/update/delete.

Other changes:

- Views and triggers are now persisted in the database, instead of using temporary views.
  - This allows reading the views using other tools.
  - It is still not possible to update the views using other tools, since triggers use the custom `powersync_diff` function to compute changes.

## 0.2.0-preview.3

- Use new write checkpoint API for reduced latency on data upload.
- Improve consistency when custom primary keys are used.
- Fix error on `getOptional()`.
- Use `gen_random_uuid()` as an alias for `uuid()` (custom function for SQLite).

## 0.2.0-preview.2

- Performance improvements in downloading changes.

## 0.2.0-preview.1

Breaking change:

- Rename internal tables to all start with `ps_`. All existing local data is deleted and re-synced.

Other changes:

- Add support for local indexes.
- Add support for local-only tables - no changes recorded, and not synced with the remote service.
- Add support for insert-only tables - records changes, but does not persist data or download from the remote service.
- Add `executeBatch()` API: execute the same statement with multiple parameter sets.
- Add `computeWithDatabase()` API: execute a function in the database isolate, with low-level synchronous database access.
- Add `onChange()` call to receive notifications of changes to a set of tables.
- Improve `watch()` to only listen for updates to relevant tables.
- Faster `uuid()` implementation.

## 0.1.1-preview.2

- Require Flutter SDK.

## 0.1.1-preview.1

- First public version.
