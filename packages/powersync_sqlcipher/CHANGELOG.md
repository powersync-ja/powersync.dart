 - Rust client: Fix uploading local writes after reconnect.

## 0.1.8

Add a new sync client implementation written in Rust instead of Dart. While
this client is still experimental, we intend to make it the default in the 
future. The main benefit of this client is faster sync performance, but 
upcoming features will also require this client.
We encourage interested users to try it out by passing `SyncOptions` to the
`connect` method:

```dart
database.connect(
  connector: YourConnector(),
  options: const SyncOptions(
    syncImplementation: SyncClientImplementation.rust,
  ),
);
```

Switching between the clients can be done at any time without compatibility
issues. If you run into issues with the new client, please reach out to us!

## 0.1.7

 - Allow subclassing open factory for SQLCipher.

## 0.1.6

* Report real-time progress information about downloads through `SyncStatus.downloadProgress`.
* Add `trackPreviousValues` option on `Table` which sets `CrudEntry.previousValues` to previous values on updates.
* Add `trackMetadata` option on `Table` which adds a `_metadata` column that can be used for updates.
  The configured metadata is available through `CrudEntry.metadata`.
* Add `ignoreEmptyUpdates` option which skips creating CRUD entries for updates that don't change any values.
